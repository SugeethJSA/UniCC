## Overview

UniCC is a web application designed specifically for students of a particular university.  
It provides a clean, minimalist interface to access campus-related information such as attendance, grades, schedules, hostel status, and file storage.

## Backend Usage (Important)

### 🔹 Recommended: Use the Hosted Backend (Preferred)

Hosting your own backend is **not recommended** unless you specifically need to, as it requires:
- A MongoDB database
- A Backblaze B2 bucket for file storage

Instead, you can directly use the **hosted UniCC backend API**: ```https://uniccapi.uni-cc.site/```
To do this, modify the API base URL in: `src/components/custom/main.tsx` Change it to:
```ts
export const API_BASE = "https://uniccapi.uni-cc.site";
```
---
## Optional: Hosting Your Own Backend
If you choose to host your own backend, create a .env file with the following variables:
```
MONGODB_URI=

B2_ENDPOINT=
B2_BUCKET_NAME=
B2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
B2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
B2_REGION=

ADMINS=
ID_SALT=

SMTP_PASS=
SMTP_USER=
SMTP_HOST=
```
### Starting the backend
```bash
npm run api-build
npm run api-start
```
> Note: MongoDB and Backblaze B2 must be configured correctly for the backend to function.
---
## API Endpoints
Each endpoint performs the function implied by its name.
The backend exposes the following endpoints:

```ts
app.use("/api/status", statusRoutes);
app.use("/api/calendar", calendarRoutes);
app.use("/api/login", loginRoutes);

app.use("/api/hostel", hostelRoutes);        // Hostel / mess status
app.use("/api/grades", gradesRoutes);        // Overall grades + CGPA
app.use("/api/schedule", scheduleRoutes);
app.use("/api/attendance", attendanceRoutes);
app.use("/api/all-grades", allGradesRoutes); // Semester-wise grades

app.use("/api/files/upload/:userID", UploadFile);
app.use("/api/files/fetch/:userID", fetchFiles);
app.use("/api/files/delete/:userID/:fileID", deleteFile);
app.use("/api/files/download/:userID/:fileID", downloadFile);
```
